Small bugs that need to be fixed eventually:
The delete button returns to the hover state after a file deletion. It won't go back to active state until you pass over it with the mouse.

Fixed Bugs:
When the new list of files is generated after a watcher event is raised, the current image should remain the same. => So that the following
image was the same as it was before unless another image was inserted in its place. ie. Order should be preserved.
